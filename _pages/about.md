I am a Statistics PhD Student under the supervision of [Prof. Qifan Song](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~qfsong/) working on Robust ML. Adversarial Vulnerability in ML models is still an active research and I try to provide mathematical perspective to understand and provide solutions to the same. My Bachelors-Masters training is in Mathematics from [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/). I was fortunate to get industry experience on large scale ML research at [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com/).

My research interests include:
 - Adversarial Robustness (Computer Vision, LLM safety alignment)
 - Generative Models
 - Graph Neural Networks
 - Optimization Theory and Mathematical Intepretability in ML
